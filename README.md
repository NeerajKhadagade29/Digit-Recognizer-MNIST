# Digit-Recognizer-MNIST

This is my first computer vision project, Digit Recognizer using MNIST dataset, using deep neural newtworks. 

I was successful to obtain a test accuracy of 98.71 % (right before uploading the code). I shall be uploading more such in future.

If there are any corrections, suggestions, improvements or any recommendations, please feel free to DM me or mail me at n.khadagade711@gmail.com.

Thank you! :)
